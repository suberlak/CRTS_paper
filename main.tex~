% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

We present improved error analysis for the 3,800 CRTS (Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey) optical quasar light curves from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 catalog. SDSS imaging survey has provided a time-resolved photometric  dataset which greatly improved our understanding of the quasar optical continuum variability: data for monthly and longer timescales  are consistent with a damped random walk. Recently, newer data  obtained by CRTS (Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey) provided  puzzling evidence for enhanced variability, compared to SDSS results, on monthly time scales. Quantitatively, SDSS results predict  about $0.06$ mag rms variability for timescales below 50 days, while CRTS data show about a factor of two larger root-mean-square  for spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars. Our analysis presented here has successfully resolved this discrepancy as due to slightly underestimated photometric error estimates provided by the CRTS image processing pipelines. The photometric error correction factors, derived from detailed analysis of non-variable SDSS standard stars that were re-observed by CRTS, are about $20-30\%$, and result in a quasar variability behavior implied by the CRTS data fully consistent with earlier SDSS results.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Quasar variability is an important characteristic that has a potential to shed light on the structure of the innermost region of the accretion disk, and has been the subject of research for the past half century (Matthew, Sandage 1963, Vanden Berk + 2004, Grier+2012, Kozlowski+2016). The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, Schmidt+2010, Sesar+2007) and Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS, Djorgovski+2012, Drake+2009) allowed an unprecedented study of well-calibrated light curves. 

Assuming that the observed  variability of a lightcurve -   discretely sampled time series -  is caused by a continuous underlying physical phenomenon, to characterise it we can use a mathematical formalism of a stochastic process model (Kasliwal+2015). A one-parameter Auto-Regressive, AR(1), process  may correspond to the physical situation of an environment where a disturbance is diffused and returns to the median value. Various explanations exist for the nature of such disturbances,  including supernovae, microlensing, accretion disk instabilities, and thermal fluctuations  (Kelly+2009, Kelly+2011, Collier\&Peterson 2001, Ruan+2014).  Most likely, thanks to  Reverberation Mapping studies (Peterson 2004, Fausnaugh+2016,  Munoz+2016), we understand the accretion disk to be  the main source of the underlying variability. 

At the cadence of the CRTS survey (more than few days), the AR(1) process (Damped Random Walk model) describes well the quasar variability ( Butler & Bloom 2011, MacLeod+2010,2011,2012, Kelly+2009, Zu+2011,2013, Kozlowski+2010a, Ruan+2012).  [A deviation from the DRW model at very short timescales, reported by Kasliwal+2015, is based on Kepler lightcurves at cadences shorter than a day, which is below the observational limit of CRTS. For this reason, in this paper DRW is assumed to be a good descriptor of the quasar stochastic variability].
 
The DRW model has two parameters - an amplitude of variability, and a characteristic timescale, that corresponds to the timescale of damping of thermal oscillations or orbital timescale (Kelly+2009).   When the lightcurves are sparsely sampled,  it is more meaningful to describe their ensemble properties,  using the structure function (SF), which is  well defined for a collection of variable objects driven by the DRW (Kozlowski+2010, 2016, Vanden Berk+2004, Schmidt+2010, Hawkins+2002)

 Recent SDSS-based studies (MacLeod+2010, Kelly+2009) reflect the traditional timescale of $\tau > 100 $ days in quasar rest frame, supported by OGLE results of Zu+2014 with $ 17 \leq \tau \leq 2700 $ days. However, a CRTS-based study of Graham+2014 that used Slepian Wavelet Variance methodology found $\tau ~ 54$ days. The latter is consistent with the Kepler-based results of Kasliwal+2015 for cadences above a day, who found   $ 17 \leq \tau \leq 2700 $ days.  The aim of this paper is to revisit the analysis of the CRTS quasars using a  well-tested approach of the Structure Function, and detailed error analysis (MacLeod+2010, MacLeod+2012, Simonetti+1984, Vanden Berk+2004, Sumi+2005, Bauer+2009). 
 
In section \ref{sec:obs} we describe the properties of our dataset, all selection criteria, and the structure function analysis.  In section \ref{sec:err_analysis} we explain the results of our analysis of the small timescale subset of the structure function. This is followed by discussion of the impact of our result, and conclusions in sections \ref{sec:discussion} and \ref{sec:conclusions}.
 

\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:obs}

\subsection{Data overview}

Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) employed three telescopes ( "0.7 m Catalina Sky Survey Schmidt and 1.5 m Mount Lemmon Survey telescopes in Arizona, and the 0.5 m Siding Springs Survey Schmidt in Australia" Graham+2015), each with a  4kx4k CCD detector (Djorgovski+2011). All observations were taken in an unfiltered white light, and calibrated to the Johnson system V-band zero point (Drake+2013). In this research we use CRTS lightcurves of 7932 spectroscopically-confirmed QSOs and 52133 standard stars  from the equatorial region of the sky ($22h 24m < R.A. < 04h 08m$ and $| Dec | < 1.27 deg$)  known as the Stripe 82 (Sesar+2010). Our sampling criterion : more than 10 measurements per lightcurve, leaves 7707 quasars and 49385 stars.  To improve signal to noise we perform day-averaging, and thus we  also require more than 10 individual days of observations per lightcurve, leaving in the final sample 7601 quasars and 48250 stars (see Fig.\ref{fig:CRTS_QSO_stats} for statistical description of the quasar sample). 

We complement the CRTS data for each object  with the SDSS photometry by creating a positionally cross-matched catalog using astropy  \verb|match_to_catalog_sky| routine [matching radius distribution : describe or figure? + need to discard those few objects that had larger matching radius]. For stars we used the SDSS Stripe 82 standard stars catalog  ver. 2.6  (Ivezic+2007), and for quasars the SDSS DR7 (Abazajian+2009) stripe 82 catalog for  8974 quasars.  

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:CRTS_QSO_stats}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig_1_Stats_CRTS_QSO_used.png}
 \caption{Statistical information about the CRTS QSO final sample of 7601 day-averaged light curves. The upper-left panel shows the number of days that a given quasar was observed, i.e. $max(MJD)-min(MJD)$ per light curve. The upper-right panel shows the average light curve magnitude. The bottom-left panel shows the light curve averaged error. If $i$, $i+1$ are two consecutive day-averaged observations in the light curve, then $MJD_{i} - MJD_{i+1}$ is the sampling interval. The bottom-right panel shows light curve - averaged sampling intervals. The light curve and sample-averaged mean and median error is 0.22. The mean  brightness is 19.50, and the mean number of individual observations per light curve  is 209. Within that sample , $96 \% $ observations of quasars span the time of 7-9 years.  $91.2\%$ of  quasars were observed between 1 to 4 times per night.}
\end{figure}


To improve the signal-to-noise ratio we performed day-averaging of light curves. The day-magnitude is the mean of individual measurements, and the day-error $e_{w}$ is the weighted sum of individual errors $e_{i}$: 

\begin{equation}
 e_{w} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{\sum_{i} w_{i}}}
\end{equation}

where $ w_{i} = 1 / e_{i}^{2}$ is the weight assigned to each point. To avoid unphysically small error values, we added  $0.01$ $mag$ to $e_{w}$ in quadrature if $e_{w}<0.02$ $mag$. [A typical sampling interval of day-averaged CRTS Quasar lightcurves is $\approx 20$ days.] 

\subsection{Structure Function}

The structure function is a well-studied approach to characterising quasar light curves. It describes the relationship between the time lag and the amplitude of brightness variability (Cristiani+1996, Schmidt+2010, Vanden Berk +2004, de Vries + 2005, Rengstorf + 2006). 

 Similarly to Schmidt+2010, we  calculate the structure function for all objects  using  the magnitude difference $\Delta m _{i,j}$ between light curve points $i$ and $j$, separated by a time lag $\Delta t_{i,j}$. To avoid the additional uncertainty of redshift estimates based on the SDSS spectra, we also use time lags in the observed frame. We add the error information in quadrature: $e_{ij} = \sqrt{e_{i}^{2}+e_{j}^{2}}$. Such 'master file' containing  

To analyze the magnitude difference  we bin the $\Delta m _{i,j}$ points from all objects  it in logarithmic $\Delta t_{i,j}$  space. The number of chosen bins is a choice of convenience between very coarse grid (a small number of bins) or a very fine grid, risking a small number of points per bin. Having performed tests  with $50$, $100$, $200$, $400$ bins we find that $N=200$ is the right choice between computational efficiency and information content. 

We calculate the $SF$ using an exact prescription involving marginalizing the log-likelihood of the probability in $p(SF)$ and $p(\mu)$ space per bin, after [Ivezic+2013], chapter 5: 
 
\begin{equation}
\centering
\frac{d p(SF}{d SF } \bigg| _{SF = mode} = 0
\end{equation}

For each bin we calculate four statistical descriptors, shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:panel_plots} -  standard deviation from the mean ($\sigma$, Gaussian robust deviation from the mean $\sigma_{G}=0.7414 (q_{75}-q_{25})$, the Structure Function ($SF$) and the mean ($\mu$).  

To show the departure of the CRTS quasars from the DRW model we fit to the $SF$ a  fiducial DRW  model:
\begin{equation}
SF(\Delta t) = SF_{\infty} \cdot \left( 1-e^{-\Delta t / \tau} \right) ^ {1/2}
\end{equation}

with model error $\sqrt{SF(\Delta t) ^ {2} + err_{SF} ^ {2}}$. 



\begin{figure}
\label{fig:panel_plots}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{Fig_2_18.5-19_panels_fc-1.0_NEW}.png}
 \caption{The four panels show statistics calculated for the subsample of 333 CRTS quasars (black points), 1400 "blue" stars (blue points), and 2087 "red" stars (red points), all  chosen according to the SDSS r magnitude $18.5 < m < 19$.  For "red"  stars we require that SDSS colors are $1 < g-i < 3$ and  for "blue" stars $-1 < g-i < 1$. Lightcurve-derived  pairwise brightness differences for all objects of a given type are binned according to  linearly spaced $200$ bins in $\Delta_{t}$. The binning was not found to affect the main features of the plot.  The sine-like modulation reflects differences in number of points in each bin (from tens to hundreds of thousands per bin). For each bin, we calculated for each type of object the standard deviation $\sigma_{stdev}$, the robust Gaussian standard deviation $\sigma_{G}$ (from the interquartile range $0.7414 (q_{75}-q_{25}$), Structure Function and the mean(using eqs.$5.67-5.68$ in $Ivezic+2004$ (the AstroML book). Yellow dashed line on the SF panel traces the fiducial Damped Random Walk model. Note how both blue and red stars do not exhibit signs of variability as expected, whereas quasars (black) clearly show an intrinsic variability. At the low timescales $\log{\tau} < 1.7$ CRTS quasar $SF$ departs from the fiducial model of Structure Function.  }

 \caption{The top panels show how the histogram of  $\chi = \Delta_{m}/ \mathrm{error}$ for small 
timescales ($\log{\Delta_{t}} < 1.7$, $t<50$ days) for  quasars (red) overlaps almost perfectly with blue stars (blue). The  implied small quasar variability is at the level  measured by SDSS.  From left to right, we iterate over the  magnitude bins :  $17-18$,  $18-18.5$, and $18.5-19$ mag. From top to bottom we change the  $\log{\Delta_{t}}$  range. Note how  the  stars, being nonvariable, maintain the same spread of $\chi$, due to their lack of intrinsic variability. The quasars spread more thanks to their intrinsic variability, but at small timescales their spread is same as that of stars, consistent with their lack of short timescale variability. On each plot numbers in the upper-left corner indicate the $\log{\Delta_{t}}$ range, and in the upper-right the robust width of stellar and quasar distributions of $\chi$. }

\section{Results of detailed sample error analysis}
\label{sec:err_analysis}
To study  the intrinsic variability of quasars we use the standard stars that do not exhibit any intrinsic variability as the control sample. We define our sample in a following way: for both stars and quasars, we require SDSS  r-band $17< m_{SDSS,r} < 20$, and the CRTS lightcurve-averaged error  to be   $0.05 < \langle <e_{w}> \rangle < 0.3$. To assess the influence of colors on variability,  we divide the comparison stars into two color bins: "red" with   $1 < g-i < 3$ and "blue" $-1 < g-i < 1$,  using SDSS $g$ and $i$ filters . To study the structure function and error properties in greater detail we further subdivide this sample into three magnitude bins: 17-18, 18-18.5, and 18.5-19 mag. Fig.~\ref{fig:panel_plots}, shows the 18.5-19 mag, which illustrates the problem : nonzero structure function even for the blue stars. Quasars show the SF on the similar level to blue stars.  A quantity $\chi = \Delta_{m}/ \mathrm{error}$, shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:histograms} for four different $\log{\Delta_{t}}$ regimes illustrates the point.  
For each magnitude-$\log{\Delta_{t}}$   bin we calculate a set of properties: the  median CRTS lightcurve error, the robust standard deviation of $\Delta_{m}$,    median CRTS lightcurve day-averaged magnitude, median CRTS lightcurve average error, and the robust standard deviation of  the $\chi$ distribution. For stars, which have no intrinsic variability, the width of $\chi$ distribution should be 1.  Any deviation from that is due to unaccounted errors. For this reason we define the $ f_{c,B}$ - the correction factor from blue stars, as the width of $\chi$ distribution for blue stars in the short timescale bin ($\log{\Delta_{t}} < 1.7$) (see Table~\ref{tab:chi_values} for values of $\chi$ for other bins). Applying thus derived correction factors to the overall sample shows that the structure function for the blue stars is brought to values allowed by the sky photometric variability (0.05 mag level, green dashed line on Fig.~\ref{fig:CRTS_QSO_sample}). Values of $\chi$ for various magnitude-  bins is shown in .

At short time scales, the quasar variability seen in CRTS data is consistent with that from SDSS, shown by horizontal green lines. }

CRTS errors were underestimated at the 20-30 \% level.

Implications:  * information from correspondence with M. Graham
